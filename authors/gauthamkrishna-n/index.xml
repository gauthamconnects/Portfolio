      <description>So the site is designed as I wanted and now its time to host it on github pages and make it public so that people can access it.
I created a github repository named Portfolio so that the necessary files can be uploaded there to host the site.Before that I have to convert the markdown(.md) files into HTML,JavaScript,CSS etc.. to do that I gave &amp;ldquo;canonifyURLs=true&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;config.toml&amp;rdquo; file of the root directory.</description>

      <description>So now that the site is set up locally to be designed as per my wish I did start making changes and the main page of the site looked like this at first.
Main Page Link to heading First of all I decided to make changes in the main page.To do that I opened &amp;ldquo;config.toml&amp;rdquo; in the root directory then changed the title,author,description,keywords,info etc.. and I also replaced the avatar image with a picture of myself after adding my picture to the images folder in the static directory and mentioning the path to the image in &amp;ldquo;config.</description>

      <description>As I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any prior knowledge about hugo my first step was to get to know about hugo and how it works before using it to build a website as the task asks me to do.So I googled about hugo,visited the official site and saw a few Youtube videos of using hugo themes to build a portfolio site.
So now I had to install hugo into my system and used &amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install git&amp;rdquo; to install hugo using the terminal.</description>
